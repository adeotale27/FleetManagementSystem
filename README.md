# Fleet Manager v1.18.1

Transport office software for one or many logistics businesses.

- **Business owner** operates three simple booking screens—Dashboard, Receipts, and Ledger—alongside separate industrial Trips & LRs, Fleet, Parties, Team, Industrial Finance, and Industrial Reports.
- **Business owner** can administer multiple sites, assign site managers, configure per-site receipt conversion, print language and address visibility, review site operations, reconcile per-trip ledgers, record LR payments, and complete/lock a trip ledger.
- **Site manager** operates only assigned site bookings and granted actions; closing or reopening trips is owner-only, and industrial business routes are owner-only.
- Receipt data is entered and edited in English in one combined goods/description field per row (three rows are shown by default); receiver city defaults to Hinganghat. Receipt conversion and address visibility are configurable per site. Admins configure the receipt fee under Booking settings; each receipt retains the fee recorded when it was created, and that fee is included in Booking Finance and payment balances. Older receipts without a stored fee retain the ₹2 legacy fallback.
- Only the business owner can mark an LR as paid or complete a trip ledger. Completion records any outstanding Bhada as a payment and locks receipt, ledger, and payment changes for that trip.
- **Platform owner** issues licences, suspends businesses, resets owner passwords, and turns modules on/off per business; platform access does not grant business-owner access.

Current application version: **v1.18.1**. See [VERSION.md](VERSION.md) for the release policy and changelog.

## 1. What you need on your machine

| Tool | Version (tested) | Why |
|------|------------------|-----|
| Python | 3.10+ | Backend (FastAPI) |
| Node.js | 18+ (npm included) | Frontend (React) |
| MongoDB | 6+ | Database |

Install MongoDB Community and start it so `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017` answers.

---

## 2. Get the code

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

---

## 3. Environment files (required)

Copy the examples. Do not commit real `.env` files.

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
```

### `backend/.env`

| Key | Default in example | Meaning |
|-----|--------------------|---------|
| `MONGO_URL` | `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017` | MongoDB connection |
| `DB_NAME` | `fleet_db` | Primary business DB name |
| `JWT_SECRET` | change this | Signs login tokens |
| `OWNER_USERNAME` | `owner` | Business owner login |
| `OWNER_PASSWORD` | `owner123` | Business owner password |
| `PLATFORM_USERNAME` | `superadmin` | Platform owner login |
| `PLATFORM_PASSWORD` | `super123` | Platform owner password |

Optional (logo / document uploads only): not required. Files save under `backend/data/uploads/`.

### `frontend/.env`

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Backend origin (no trailing `/api`) |

Optional later: `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.

After changing frontend env, restart `npm start`.

---

## 4. Run locally (two terminals)

### Terminal A — MongoDB

If MongoDB is not already a service:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew services start mongodb-community

# Ubuntu
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

### Terminal B — backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

On start the backend **creates / refreshes**:

- Platform user `superadmin` (role `superadmin`)
- Business `naidu` = New Naidu Transport
- Business users `owner` and `priyanshu` (role `owner`)

API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs  
API prefix: `http://localhost:8000/api/...`

### Terminal C — frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**

If port 3000 is taken, CRA will offer another port. The backend URL in `frontend/.env` does not change.

---

## 5. Logins (v1 defaults)

Sign-in page: http://localhost:3000/login

| Who | Username | Password | After login |
|-----|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Platform owner** | `superadmin` | `super123` | **`/platform`** — licences for all businesses |
| **Business owner** | `owner` | `owner123` | **`/booking/dashboard`** — Booking Dashboard |
| Same business (alt) | `priyanshu` | `owner123` | Same office as `owner` |
| **Site manager** | Created by the business owner | Set during assignment/reset | Assigned-site workspace at **`/booking/dashboard`** |

These values come from `backend/.env`. If you change them, restart the backend; seed will update name/role and **reset the password** if it no longer matches the env file.

---

## 6. Platform owner — how it works

Code: `backend/auth.py` (seed + `require_super`), `backend/server.py` (`/api/platform/...`), `frontend/src/pages/Platform.jsx`.

1. Log in as `superadmin`.
2. You land on **Platform Control**.
3. You can:
   - Issue a **new business licence** (new login + its own MongoDB)
   - **Suspend / activate** a licence (suspended owners cannot sign in)
   - **Reset** that business owner’s password
   - **Customise** modules (Trips, Vehicles, Finance, GPS, charts, …) for that business only

Platform APIs (Bearer JWT, role must be `superadmin`):

| Method | Path | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| GET | `/api/platform/summary` | Totals + every tenant + stats |
| GET | `/api/platform/tenants` | Licence list |
| POST | `/api/platform/tenants` | Create licence + owner user |
| PUT | `/api/platform/tenants/{id}` | Status, plan, features, expiry |
| POST | `/api/platform/tenants/{id}/reset-password` | New owner password (min 6 chars) |

Business-owner tokens get **403** on these routes.

---

## 7. Business owner — business modules

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `/booking/dashboard` | Choose a date, create an open trip, and select a trip for its receipts |
| `/booking/receipts` | Create/edit/print branded Hindi receipts; sender is optional and goods rows include descriptions |
| `/booking/ledger` | Select one trip for a date and view its plain spreadsheet-style ledger. Sender/receiver and comma-separated goods/quantities are Hindi and read-only; only Bhada and Hamali are editable. Creator names are shown. Print or export that trip's ledger to `.xlsx`. |
| `/sites` | Legacy browser path redirects to `/booking/dashboard` |
| `/booking-finance`, `/booking-reports` | Legacy browser paths redirect to `/booking/ledger` |
| `/booking-setup` | Owner-only site, manager-access and booking-category administration |
| `/dashboard` | Redirects to the Booking Dashboard |
| `/trips?tab=trips` | Owner-only Industrial Trips (indoor / outdoor), status, cancel = reverse |
| `/trips?tab=lrs`, `/lrs/new`, `/lrs/:id` | Owner-only Industrial LRs; create / print |
| `/vehicles` | Fleet, documents, fuel, pumps |
| `/parties` | Customers, outstanding, ledger, payments |
| `/team` | Drivers and office staff, advances, salary |
| `/finance` | Industrial cash/bank, collections, payables, Deewanji, diesel, 3PL |
| `/reports` | Industrial reports + CSV / Excel / PDF / print |
| `/settings` | Company, routes, numbering, opening cash/bank |

Industrial money is derived from unscoped (`site_id` absent) `ledger`, `cashbook` and `expenses` records. Site booking entries use separate trip/LR/payment collections and tag shared expense/ledger/cashbook rows with `site_id`; they are visible through the booking workspace, not industrial Finance or Reports. The redesigned booking pages use the existing canonical site records and keep booking charges separate from industrial balances.

---

## 8. Data layout (MongoDB)

`DB_NAME` default `fleet_db`.

Booking and industrial workflows are distinct record families within each tenant database; they are not separate MongoDB databases. Industrial operations use `trips`/`lrs`; site bookings use `site_trips`/`site_lrs` and site payment/reconciliation records. Vehicles, drivers and selected party/master records are shared. No data migration or collection replacement is introduced by this separation.

| Database | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `fleet_db_platform` | `users`, `tenants` (licences) |
| `fleet_db` | Primary tenant `naidu` (New Naidu Transport) collections |
| `fleet_db_BusinessName_OwnerName` | Every additional licensed business |

Users collection id = username. Roles include `superadmin` (no tenant), `owner` (has `tenant_id`), and owner-created `site_manager` accounts (tenant and explicitly assigned site/action grants).

---

## 9. Multi-site business workflow (v1.2.0)

### Owner: create sites and assign access

1. Sign in as the business owner. The default booking page is **Dashboard** at `/booking/dashboard`; authorized managers land in the same three-screen workspace.
2. Create a site with a unique short code and an IANA timezone such as `Asia/Kolkata`. Codes are unique within the business.
3. Assign a site manager with a unique username and a strong initial password. The password is bcrypt-hashed; managers access only explicitly assigned sites and permitted actions.
4. Use manager access controls to grant/revoke per-site actions, reset credentials, replace a manager, or deactivate access. Deactivation preserves audit history and does not rewrite historical trip/LR creators.
5. Open Dashboard, choose the trip date, and create a trip. Vehicle and driver details are optional.
6. Select the trip and open Receipts. Each receipt is linked to that trip; its first three goods rows are ready immediately, with additional rows available if needed. Enter each good, its optional description, and quantity in English; configured Hindi conversion supplies Hindi goods/description output. The receiver's 10-digit phone number is saved and printed. Owners configure Hindi conversion, print language, address visibility, and the receipt fee under **Booking settings**.
7. Use **Save & print** or print a saved receipt again. The compact A4 LR prints Hindi goods, descriptions, and quantities inline and shows Bhada, Hamali, the recorded receipt fee, and the total. When editing, **Cancel editing** discards the form changes without saving.
8. Use **Ledger** to select one trip for the chosen date. Sender, receiver, goods/quantity, date, and receipt number are read-only; only Bhada and Hamali are editable. The sheet, print view, and `.xlsx` export are scoped to that selected trip and display goods/quantities in Hindi.

### Site manager: trips, LRs and collections

Site managers use the normal login and see only Dashboard, Receipts and Ledger for assigned sites. They can create a trip without a vehicle or driver and add multiple receipts under the selected trip. Only the business owner can close or reopen trips. The selected vehicle/driver remain attached to the trip and are not re-entered on each receipt. The operating date uses the site's timezone. Trip/LR numbering is server-generated and atomic; truck number is descriptive, not an identifier. Owners can reopen a closed trip with a recorded reason.

Sender/receiver addresses and phone numbers are optional. Printing uses the browser print dialog and can also save to PDF. Financial fields/actions follow the manager's existing site permissions; charge editing still requires `finance:update` as well as receipt-update permission.

Create/update actions show a top-right success or failure notice. Unexpected server failures use a reference ID; platform owners can use it to find the sanitized diagnostic in the platform error log. Validation feedback remains visible to the person correcting the form.

### Trip ledger export and reconciliation

Owners can download separate versioned CSV files for goods-wise and receiver-wise ledgers, a summary, and an import template for a selected trip. CSV has no worksheet concept, so these are separate files. The template includes immutable LR/trip/site IDs; receiver names and row order are never matching keys.

Closing a trip locks receipt creation and ordinary edits. Reopening is owner-only and requires an audit reason. Voiding is audited and preserves the receipt; it is limited to receipts with no charges or payment history so accounting history is not silently discarded. Historical booking rows remain in `site_trips` and `site_lrs`; the redesign requires no data migration. On first startup, site storage adds a partial unique index for receipt idempotency. Rollback: deploy the previous application release and, if desired, drop the MongoDB index named `site_lr_idempotency_unique` from tenant databases; no records need to be transformed.

1. Select the site and trip, then upload the completed CSV template.
2. Review the entire staged preview: matched records, changes, missing/unknown IDs, duplicates, invalid values and scope conflicts.
3. Correct or skip rows and explicitly acknowledge missing LRs where appropriate.
4. Confirm only after resolving the preview. Cancellation leaves trip/LR/financial data unchanged.
5. Review the reconciliation result and audit entry. Re-uploading an identical file is idempotent and returns the existing import result.

Imports are owner-only and tied to one business, site and trip. They update rent/hamali and payment details by LR ID. Payment events are auditable; partial payments are supported and reversals create separate events. Outstanding amounts derive from reconciled rent and actual payments. Hamali is a separate recorded charge, not collected rent or a cost.

### Existing businesses: explicit legacy assignment

Legacy records are not silently assigned to a site. First create the intended default site. As owner, review the **Legacy migration** preview and unassigned counts, then explicitly apply the assignment. The migration is repeatable and fills only missing site IDs; it does not reassign already-scoped records. Back up the tenant database before production migration.

### Multi-site API groups

All paths below are under `/api` and use the normal bearer token. Owner-only actions are enforced server-side.

| API group | Route examples | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Sites/managers | `/sites`, `/sites/{site_id}`, `/sites/{site_id}/manager`, `/sites/managers/...` | Site lifecycle, assignment, grants and credential operations |
| Bookings board | `/sites/system-dashboard`, `/sites/{site_id}/dashboard` | Business-wide and authorized site summaries and outstanding breakdowns |
| Booking LR report | `/sites/system-reports/lrs` | Owner-only date/site/search filtered and paginated report from canonical `site_lrs` |
| Trips | `/sites/{site_id}/trips...`, `/sites/{site_id}/trip-resources`, `/sites/{site_id}/trips/{trip_id}/expenses` | Scoped trip lifecycle, fleet/driver dropdown choices, and ledger-posted trip expenses |
| LRs/categories | `/sites/{site_id}/trips/{trip_id}/lrs...`, `/sites/{site_id}/categories` | Booking, paging, audited edits including charge sheet updates, categories and details |
| Payments/audit | LR `/payments` routes including `/retry`, `/sites/{site_id}/audit` | Payment/reversal events, interrupted posting retry and audit history |
| Ledger | `/sites/{site_id}/trips/{trip_id}/ledger/{section}`, `ledger-imports/...` | CSV export, staged preview/edit/commit and private original download |
| Legacy migration | `/sites/migration/legacy` | Owner preview and explicit assignment of unscoped legacy records |

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for diagrams, data boundaries, indexes and retry behavior. API docs are at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## 11. Quick API check (optional)

With backend running:

```bash
# Platform owner
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"superadmin","password":"super123"}'

# Business owner
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"owner","password":"owner123"}'
```

Use the returned `token` as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

---

## 12. Common problems

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Backend crash on `MONGO_URL` / `JWT_SECRET` | Create `backend/.env` from the example |
| `Wrong username or password` for superadmin | Confirm `PLATFORM_*` in `backend/.env`, restart uvicorn |
| Frontend calls the wrong host | `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` must be origin only, then restart `npm start` |
| Blank page / CORS | Backend must be on port 8000 (or match the frontend env) |
| Backend startup reports `IndexKeySpecsConflict` for `site_trip_expense_idempotency_unique` | Deploy the compatible index declaration in v1.3.1 and restart. It reuses the existing index; do not drop collections or reset tenant databases. |
| Uploads fail | Expected without `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY`; rest of the app still works |
| Owner blocked after suspend | Platform owner: Activate licence on `/platform` |

Page bundles are loaded on demand and the trip list now limits its related financial aggregation to the trips in the current page. If a deployment still feels slow, capture request timings and MongoDB query plans on a representative tenant before considering a migration; do not clear production business data as a performance fix.

---

## 13. Tests (optional)

Run the focused offline multi-site unit tests with the configured backend pytest environment:

```bash
cd backend
pytest -q tests/test_site_ops_units.py
pytest -q tests/test_authorization.py tests/test_financial_separation_units.py
```

An opt-in end-to-end acceptance test is available at `backend/tests/test_site_ops_workflow.py`. It creates a site, manager, trip, two LRs, edits trip/LR values, records payments and trip expenses, exports/imports/reconciles the ledger, and checks the owner booking board. It creates persistent records and deactivates the test site/manager afterward; run it only against a disposable test tenant/API. Set `FMS_SITE_OPS_E2E_ALLOW_WRITES=1`, `FMS_SITE_OPS_E2E_BASE_URL`, `FMS_SITE_OPS_E2E_OWNER_USERNAME`, and `FMS_SITE_OPS_E2E_OWNER_PASSWORD` in the test process. It skips by default.

Build the frontend with `cd frontend && npm run build`. Existing API integration tests require a running, explicitly configured API and may create tenants or mutate trip data; inspect their fixtures and target before invoking. Never point them at production.

---

**v1.7.0** — added separate owner Booking Finance and paginated Booking Reports, reduced Booking Dashboard financial clutter, and added an audited per-LR bhada/hamali charge sheet using the canonical site LR update API. No new collection or migration. See [VERSION.md](VERSION.md).

**v1.6.0** — clearly separated daily site bookings from owner-only industrial Trips/LRs and Finance/Reports, hid industrial search/Quick Add on booking routes, and scoped site-tagged financial rows out of industrial balances, expenses and cashbook views. No migration or new booking collection. See [VERSION.md](VERSION.md).

**v1.5.0** — shared brand-derived presentation tokens, responsive navigation refinements, page-level refinements across business modules, and Booking Dashboard charts with backend-sourced daily/site data. An additive read-only dashboard response field supports the daily counts; office and site trip/LR storage remain distinct. See [VERSION.md](VERSION.md).

**v1.4.0** — owner Trips & LR visibility for site trips/LRs, a clearer Bookings Window Board, and on-demand site data loading without copying or duplicating financial records. See [VERSION.md](VERSION.md).

**v1.3.1** — startup compatibility for the deployed trip-expense index, bounded trip-list aggregation, and lazy-loaded route pages. See [VERSION.md](VERSION.md).

**v1.3.0** — operation notifications/error logging, Bookings Window Board, trip expenses, structured ledger exports, mobile trip/LR forms, and quicker LR printing. See [VERSION.md](VERSION.md).
